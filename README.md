Creating Databases and Tables:

Created a new database named student_management_system.
Created tables student, course, staff, staff_department, project_transaction, student_registration, and student_reports with specific fields and constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.
Inserting Data into Tables:

Inserted data into tables student, staff, course, project_transaction, staff_department, student_registration, and student_reports to populate them with sample records.
Querying Data:

Used SELECT statements to retrieve data from tables such as student, staff, course, project_transaction, staff_department, student_registration, and student_reports.
Altering Tables:

Altered the project_transaction table to add a new column transaction_date using ALTER TABLE.
Describing Tables:

Used DESCRIBE (DESC) to get the structure of tables like student, staff, course, project_transaction, staff_department, student_registration, and student_reports.
Foreign Key Constraints:

Established relationships between tables using foreign keys (student_reports referencing student and project_transaction, staff_department referencing course).
These queries collectively set up a basic database schema for a student management system, allowing for data insertion, retrieval, and basic relationships between students, courses, staff, and their respective transactions and reports.
